              - Whether to configure an SSL certificate and a reverse proxy for Elasticsearch.
              - If set to `true`, will use ansible-proserver-nginx and ansible-proserver-dehydrated
                to set up an Nginx-based reverse proxy with a valid SSL certificate that listens on
                0.0.0.0:443.
              - By default, HTTPS-01 challenge will be used to create the SSL certificate.
                In order for this to work, `elasticsearch.domain` has to be set to a valid, DNS-resolveable
                FQDN (defaults to `inventory_hostname`).
              - Please consult the documentation of
                [ansible-proserver-dehydrated](https://github.com/punktDe/ansible-proserver-dehydrated)
